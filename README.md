# PBT-project
This repository contains all the datasets used in the work XXX. 
The study explores the application of a deep-learning (DL) model to predict the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) of pharmaceuticals. We aim to discover substructures within molecules that are linked to PBT characteristics. By incorporating these findings into early-stage drug discovery, we can design drugs with reduced environmental impact.

The folder Compiled_dataset contains all the original files used to compile our dataset, as well as the resulting compiled dataset (our_compiled_dataset.csv). A jupyter notebook reporting the procedure followed to compile our dataset starting from the original files is also provided inside this folder. The folder Datasets contains all the other datasets used for the analyses performed in our study.

The file smiles245_substructures_r.csv contains the substructures obtained from the model interpretability analysis.

The .yml files are the conda environments used to conduct the work.
