# PBT-project
This study explores the application of a deep-learning (DL) model to predict the Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) of pharmaceuticals. We aim to discover substructures within molecules that are linked to PBT characteristics. By incorporating these findings into early-stage drug discovery, we can design drugs with reduced environmental impact.
